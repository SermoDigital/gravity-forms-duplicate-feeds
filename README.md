# Actually duplicate forms

Why, when you click Duplicate on your list of forms, does it not automatically copy over the feeds you've set up as well? Good question. Now it will.

To install in your [Sage](https://roots.io/sage) theme:

```sh
composer require "sermodigital/gravity-forms-duplicate-feeds"
```

Or simply copy the code from `gravity-forms-duplicate-feeds.php` and throw that in your `functions.php`.
